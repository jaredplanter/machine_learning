In addition to her ongoing classical piano studies, she was a frequent participant, as both keyboardist and vocalist, in rock, blues and jazz bands throughout high school and college.  As a student at Hokkaido University of Education, she began appearing regularly in the clubs, concerts, and music festivals of the city. After graduating, she also developed her interest toward art education with her teaching experience of music and visual art in the city public school system. These experiences motivated her to study more improvisational music and to find innovative approaches which nurture sensibilities and creativity towards art education in the USA. She was awarded the Cultural Merit Scholarship from Sapporo City and the Professional Music Scholarship from Berklee College of Music to further her studies in Boston.  Graduating from Berklee with a B.A. in music summa cum laude, she went on to receive a Master's degree in education from Lesley University in Cambridge (MA). She then continued her study at Columbia University, Teachers College (NY) for doctoral study in music education, where she was awarded a teaching assistantship and Minority Scholarship.
